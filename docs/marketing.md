# Marketing and Creative Guidelines 

## Marketing Strategy

### Event Naming Overview

Naming GDSC events is not just about conveying information; it's about creating excitement, anticipation, and a sense of belonging. Inspired by Apple's naming conventions, we aim to make our event names memorable and engaging.


### Event Naming Guidelines

1. **Simplicity**: Keep event names simple and concise. Avoid overly technical or complicated names that may deter participants. For example, instead of naming a workshop "GDSC Introductory Talk," consider "Just GDSC Things."

2. **Engagement**: Create event names that evoke curiosity or emotions. Think about how Apple names its products, such as "iPhone" or "AirPods," which are simple yet intriguing.

3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent naming style across all events to reinforce our brand identity. Use words or phrases that resonate with our mission and values.

4. **Alignment**: Ensure that event names align with the event's content and purpose. The name should provide a hint of what participants can expect.

5. **Avoid Acronyms**: Minimize the use of acronyms or technical terms in event names to make them accessible to a broader audience.

6. **Marketing names**: While event names can be kept simple, use of marketing names that are unique can spark interest. Example: "Google Hacking" is branded to "Corrupted" for marketing purposes.

## Creative Guidelines and Recommendations

### Overview

Creative guidelines ensure consistency in how the brand is presented across various channels and touchpoints. This helps in building brand recognition and trust among members.


1. **Background**: Use a consistent background White or GDSC Blue (#0077B6) (or Black/Gray for dark themed posts).

2. **Text**: Use a consistent font for the body text. Google Sans is the official Google font, but similar fonts like Montserrat can be used. Title text can vary depending on the marketing style of events.

3. **Illustrations**: Use of custom illustrations for posts is encouraged. Adds originality and unique identity.

4. **Logo placement**: The GDSC BPDC logo and BITS Pilani, Dubai Campus logo should be used in every post. The logo placement, proportions and variants should be consistent. The logo placement should be, GDSC BPDC logo on top right corner and BPDC logo on top left corner. All GDSC BPDC variants are provided in the creative folder.

5. **Creative Assets**: The GDSC BPDC creative folder is provided for future references and team evaluations. Uploading all creatives contributed to GDSC to respective folders is mandatory after every event.

6. **Minimalism**: Minimalism is appreciated and encouraged but shouldnâ€™t limit the design.

7. **Accessibility**: Ensure that text and graphics have sufficient contrast against the background to maintain readability.

8. **Whitespace**: Use adequate whitespace to improve readability and create a clean, uncluttered design.

9. **Continuity**: Design elements overflowing to the next slide to makes the design seamless.

10. **Reel covers**: Reels make up more than 50% of GDSC BPDC posts. To maintain continuity and colour theme, simple reel covers should be made simultaneously with posts and reels.

11. **Approval**: To avoid errors, posts should be double checked by an extra core member.
